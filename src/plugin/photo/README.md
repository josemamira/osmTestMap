# New implementation of leaflet.photo plugin  for Leaflet to get geophotos from Flickr API

  - Use of [Lealet.Photo plugin] (https://github.com/turban/Leaflet.Photo) by Bj√∏rn Sandvik
  - Inspired in [https://github.com/shurshur/Leaflet.Flickr] (Leaflet Flickr plugin) 
  - AJAX request adapted from [Ryan Scharfer] (https://teamtreehouse.com/community/how-do-i-get-flickr-to-respond-json-that-i-can-use)
